# Interactive rating component

My challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I can use any tools I like to help me to complete the challenge. So if I've got something I'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating.
